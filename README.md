# Interview-Preperation

The whole purpose of this repository is to just to show answers to leetcode questions and coding the interview questions that I have solved. I have divided it by folders in terms of the categories of the questions given. I am open to critisms on how I can make the algorithm more efficient

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript

I decided to use Javascript since I am looking to continue on building my skills on it since, I am looking for a role as a web developer.

## Optimizations

In terms of optimizations, I did leave for every question provided a comment on the Big O notation in terms of space and time complexity. I am open to suggestions in making it more efficient or, if you believe my notation is incorrect I am happy to discuss it with you.

## Lessons Learned:

As I continue to solve these leetcode questions and questions from cracking the coding interview, I am learning more about data structures and algorithms such as the folders I have listed so far in this repository.
